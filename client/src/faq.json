  {
    "question": "Why would I stake TRST?",
    "answer": "By staking TRST on Spring platform to a cause, you are signalling your appreciation for that particular organization, thereby increasing their visibility on Spring. All organizations on the platform must have a minimum of 5,000 TRST staked to their name in order to activate their profile on the platform. Activation allows for editing of their profile, making community updates, beyond the generic information found online. Any TRST holder can sponsor an organization to reach the threshold. In the initial period, organization's will communicate directly with the team to build out their profile. As new organizations are openly added to the platform, anyone can stake TRST to sponsor this new organization. However, if an added organization has an invalid receiving ETH address, or is in violation of the WeTrust ToS, the initial staking amount can be challenged."
